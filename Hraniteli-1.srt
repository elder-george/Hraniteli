1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.806
Three rings for the Elven-kings under the sky

2
00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:32.898
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone

3
00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:59.775
Nine for mortal men doomed to die

4
00:01:04.37475 --> 00:01:14.337
KEEPERS (Fellowship)

5
00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:23.016
A fantasy based on the novel by JRR Tolkien

6
00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.315
Part 1

7
00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:41.7293 
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

8
00:01:41.72913 --> 00:01:54.629
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,

9
00:01:54.629 --> 00:02:10.405
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

9
00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:18.780
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.”

10
00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:58.935
Our story is largely concerned with Hobbits

11 
00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:05.468 
We'll get familiar with their lifestyle and customs

12
00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:08.623
Hobbits are not famous, but they're are a very ancient people. 

13 
00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:11.844 
They love quietness and peace,

14 
00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:13.817 
ripe grains and green pastures.

15
00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:18.652
But now the world is too small and busy

16
00:03:18.652 --> 00:03:22.257
So they live in their own world.

17
00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:26.327
The world that is called Shire.

18
00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:32.709
They're small but sturdy

19
00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.024
In the days of peace and prosperity

20
00:03:36.024 --> 00:03:38.480
They live as they like

21
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.600 
- and they surely like fun.

22
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.116
Hobbits aren't warlike and never fought each other

23
00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:49.483
Maybe they love earthly goods so much

24
00:03:49.483 --> 00:03:53.383
because in the times of hardship they used to get without them

25
00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:53.646
(which is hard to believe looking at their funny faces)

26
00:03:53.646 --> 00:04:00.829
Now Hobbits are preparing for a party:

27
00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.714 
Bilbo Baggins is 111 today.

28
00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.432
Yes, yes, you heard it right: 111 years.

29
00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:13.758
Hobbits had long lives

30
00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:19.561
Even in his 111 Bilbo looks like he's 50, no more

31
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:19.561
- when there's no greediness and evil in one's soul
32
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:27.025
the body stays young longer

33
00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:35.349
— My dear friends! I'm so glad to see you here, at my party!

34
00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.987
Here're the Bulgers! here's Peregrine Took!

35
00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:46.590
Merry Brandybuck!

36
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.326
And you, my cousin, my dear Lobelia!

37
00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:56.989 
Glad to see you here!

38
00:05:56.989 -->
- Bilbo! You're too spendthrift! How much did you spend on the food? Bilbo!…

39
00:06:05.326 --> 
- This is Lobelia Sackville-Baggins! She's always the same!

40
00:06:07.418 --> 00:06:12.563
Lobelia, stop caring so much about my money-sack contents!

41
00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:26.364
Just think! 111 years! A magic number! Three "1"-s!

42
00:06:26.364 --> 00:06:30.235
Today is an important day! But we'll talk about it later…

43
00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:36.787 
- You've wasted your estate! What's left for us, your relatives, after your de…your party.

44
00:06:36.787 -->  00:06:42.327
— Did you mean "after my death"?

45
00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:51.079
- No!
- Lobelia! It's my birthday! You'll die waiting!

46
00:06:51.079 --> 00:07:20.405
- I meant "your party"! I meant "your party"!
- (laughter) She meant "your party"!
- OK, OK, "my party"!

47
00:07:02.682820.405 -->00:07:13.1259
- Smile, smile, Lobelia! You'll look as if you were 80-85, no more!

48
00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:29.409
- Ah, Gandalf! Our great mage and wizard! My dear! I know you for a century!

49
00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:30.830
I'm so glad to see you!

50
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:41.914
Yes, dear friend, long time no see! Here's my gift to you!

51
00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:54.142
- Dear friends! Welcome to the table! Help yourself!

52
00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:26.572
- So, have you decided?

53
00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:30.889
- I need a rest. Long rest. I told you before.

54
00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:45.944
I'll never come back here. And I've no reasons for that. I've done everything.

55
00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:50.556 
I got old, Gandalf, very old.

56
00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:54.322
- I think your decision is right, Bilbo.

57
00:08:54.322 --> 00:09:02.025
- Yes, I've decided. I'll leave everything to my nephew Frodo.

58
00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:08.900
He's 33 now, an adulthood for hobbits…

59
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.566
I hope, you'll keep an eye on him?

60
00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:16.186
- With both my eyes, rest assured!

61
00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:23.081
- Here, please give this envelope to him, it has all the instructions.

62
00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:27.590
I leave him everything.

63
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.404
- Everything? 
- Everything!
- And the Ring too?

64
00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:38.113
- The Ring? Where's…? No, not the Ring.

65
00:09:38.113 --> 00:09:40.218
- So where is it?

66
00:09:40.218 --> 00:09:45.038 
- Here, but I won't leave it… my precious.

67
00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:52.171
- Bilbo! I think you should leave it! Or maybe you don't want?

68
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:56.979
- Why do you care so much for this ring? Do you want it for yourself?

69
00:09:56.979 --> 00:10:03.964
No, Gandalf, I won't give away my precious.

70
00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:16.999
- Yes, Bilbo! "My precious"! Gollum, its previous owner, also called it so!
Come one, bring it here! I'm not going to take it.

71
00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:25.408
- Gandalf! I won't give up the Ring! I won't give up!

72
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:52.659
- Forgive me, Gandalf! Something happened to me… I'm better now.

73
00:10:52.659 --> 00:11:03.086
You know, I feel like someone's eye constantly looks for me…

74
00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:17.172
I got so thin, like butter on a miser's bread!

75
00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:30.771 
I know… it's the Ring… It's draining me and subjugating me!

76
00:11:38.143 --> 00:11:50.461 
- Reject, reject the RIng, Bilbo!
- All right, Gandalf. I'll leave the Ring to Frodo.

77
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:55.649
I need to say good bye to everyone.

78
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:11.948
- Dear friends! My fellow hobbits! I, Bilbo Baggins, address you!

79
00:12:11.948 --> 00:12:22.965
My precious Tooks and Brandybucks! Boffins and Goodbodies!

80
00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:29.796
I hope you have as much fun as I!
- We do!
- I'm very glad!

81
00:12:29.796 --> 00:12:44.534
- Bilbo! Live 300 years!
- Fellows, 300 is a bit too much, I won't promise that!

82
00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:52.496
- Are you happy on my birthday?
- Yes!
- I'm very glad!

83
00:12:52.496 --> 00:13:02.240
but today's there's another birthday: the birthday of my nephew Frodo!

84
00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:16.239
He's 33 today! He'd achieved full age and he's now my heir.

85
00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:34.683
With a regret I'd like to say that, while living with you is a pleasure, but I had to say good bye, fellow Hobbits…

86
00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:37.069
- Why are joking like this?
- I depart!

87
00:13:52.156 --> 00:13:59.087
- You forgot to put down something, Bilbo!

88
00:13:59.087 --> 00:14:06.692
- Excuse me, Gandalf

89
00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:53.673
- Why did he leave all his estate to this milksucker, Frodo? We the Sackville-Bagginses are the closest kin!

90
00:14:53.673 --> 00:15:02.489
- This oaf Bilbo ran away again! No rest for the old fool! But that's nothing — the food is still on the table, right?

91
00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:16.750
- Bilbo departed, right?
- Yes, he's gone.

92
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:27.113
- I was hoping it's a joke for whole day. Although, in my soul I knew — he always joked in earnest.

93
00:15:27.113 --> 00:15:32.034
- Don't worry. He'll be all right.

94
00:15:32.995 --> 00:15:43.102
- He left something for you. You're now the master of the whole estate, the whole Bag End

95
00:15:48.164 --> 00:15:55.352
- Lord, will I never see him again?

96
00:15:55.352 --> 00:16:00.068
- This envelope holds a golden ring.

97
00:16:04.322 --> 00:16:15.648
- Why, the Ring too? He even left it to me? I wonder, why? But it may come useful…

98
00:16:15.64803 --> 00:16:25.205
- Yes, it may, or may not. If I was you, I'd not touch it. It's dangerous.

99
00:16:47.794 --> 00:17:04.568
…Its evil power is so great, it will break any mortal. The bearer of the Ring doesn't die but doesn't really live either. He just tugs his life, without joy and with great hardship.

100
00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:10.853
- Horrible! But it looks so beautiful…

101
00:17:10.853 --> 00:17:25.460
- Beware! He who wears the Ring often becomes transparent, only visible to the Dark Lord, becomes a servant to the Dark forces..

102
00:17:28.642 --> 00:17:32.727
- Gandalf! Who is the Lord of the Rings? 

103
00:17:32.727 --> 00:17:47.768
- The Dark Lord reigns over the Dark forces that make all the evil in the world. He lives in the terrible land of Mordor.

104
00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:56.221
The darkness changes it shapes, grows and wants to devour the whole world.

105
00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:06.485
- I hope I'll never see it myself.
- We can't choose our own fate.

106
00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:08.541
We have little time, Frodo.

107
00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:14.532
- Why had this accursed Ring to get into our Bilbo's hands?

108
00:18:14.532 --> 00:18:21.522
- Here's why:

109
00:18:24.955 -->
- On the coasts of the great river Anduin there lived people very similar to Hobbits.
One beautiful morning, two friends, Deagol and Smeagol, went fishing.

110
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:58.144
- A bite! Hey, a bite! Aaah…

111
00:19:33.699 -->  00:19:42.174
- Look what I found!
- A ring!
- Yes, a little ring!

112
00:19:42.174 --> 00:19:52.746
- Give it to me, dear Deagol!
- Why should I?
- It's my birthday! I'd like it as a gift!

113
00:19:52.746 --> 00:20:08.309
- I gave you a gift this morning. This ring I'll leave to myself!…
- But how, my dear, but why? How can you, dear Deagol?

114
00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:29.803
- You were wrong, my dear… You were wrong… You were wrong, my dear…

115
00:20:32.894 --> 00:20:52.835
- The Ring was so wondrous, so shiny… Smeagol put it on his finger — and disappeared!
He figured that the Ring makes him invisible.

116
00:20:52.835 --> 00:21:10.542
He wore it more and more often, sneaking, eavesdropping and pranking, until his kin banished him.
This made him even more evil and turned him into a real monster.

117
00:21:43.863 --> 00:21:49.214 
…he grumbled like this all the time, so others started to call him "Gollum".

118
00:21:53.253 --> 00:22:03.620
- Tell me, Gandalf, how did you learn about the Ring and Gollum? Maybe you're making it all up?

119
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:11.578
- Some things I knew before, and some I learned. I saw Gollum!

120
00:22:29.354 --> 00:22:39.307 
- Now spit it out: where did you get the Ring?
- This is my ring, my precious! I inherited it from my grandma!

121
00:22:39.307 --> 00:22:59.411
- From grandma? You're lying, lad! Your grandma was practical, sure, but I don't think her household kept the Rings of Power!
And she wouldn't give them to a villain you are.
- She had a lot of trinkets!

122
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:06.494 
Gollum dropped the Ring in a cave; this is where our Bilbo found it. Now it's yours, my boy.

123
00:23:06.494 --> 00:23:08.964
- What else had he told you?

124
00:23:09.573 --> 00:23:36.456
- I'd threatened him with fire, and he told me the real story. I learned how he lost the Ring… 
After that he all petrified and just whined, as if some horror had chained his tongue.
But he also hinted that he found some wonderful friends and they'll teach everyone a lesson in Orcish.

125
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:39.511
- "Orcish"? Horror, what's "Orcs"?

126
00:23:39.511 --> 00:23:54.925
- They are Hobbits' enemies. You'll learn it later.
It looked like he already was brought to the Dark Lord in Mordor, and the Enemy pulled out of him, where the Ring of Power is, and that you hold it.

127
00:23:54.925 --> 00:24:11.105
…Your sweet Shire is in danger.
- No, no!… You know what? Gandalf, I've an idea: let's destroy the Ring now! We'll throw it in the fireplace!

128
00:24:11.105 --> 00:24:26.109
- No. The ring was forged deep in the mount Orodruin and can be destroyed only there - if you really want to make it disappear.

129
00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:37.376
- Gandalf, your story is so long that I got hungry again.
- Yes, you'd better have a meal before a long trip.

130
00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:45.148
- What trip?
- You're not a simple Hobbit, Frodo. You're a chosen one.

131
00:24:45.148 --> 00:24:52.807
- "a chosen one"?
- …and great trials await you.
Look, there's an inscription inside the Ring.

132
00:24:52.807 --> 00:25:18.149
…Nine for mortal men doomed to die

133
00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:31.806
- You'll be hunted by nine Black Riders, servants of the Darkness. They'll put obstacles on your way.

134
00:25:31.806 --> 00:25:37.031
- Nine Black Riders… Obstacles…  But surely you'll help me!

135
00:25:37.031 -->
- No… I'm a Wizard. And only a simple Hobbit can destroy the Ring. You, Frodo.
- I? Alone?

136
00:25:47.011 --> 00:26:05.332
- You won't be alone. Your friends will join you!
- My friends!
- Yes! Jolly Merry Brandybuck, caring Sam Gamgee, strong as a bull Peregrin Took.

137
00:26:05.332 --> 00:26:09.751
- Well, my friends! Let's go!

138
00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:24.428
- But wait… you need to change name. You were Frodo Baggins, now you'll be called Frodo Underhill.
- Underhill…

139
00:26:26.569 --> 00:26:37.985
- And one more thing. Once you leave you'll meet your first trial: the winter will come.

140
00:26:37.985 --> 00:26:43.211
- Gandalf! How come? I'm afraid of cold, it's always summer in Shire… I won't go anywhere!

141
00:26:43.211 --> 00:26:55.135
- Yes it's always summer in Shire, but the road goes through winter. Onwards, Frodo!
- Onwards it is then…

142
00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:40.341
Here's how the long travel from Shire to Mordor started.

143
00:27:41.422 --> 00:27:51.206
The raindrops sang their song, then first snowflake came.
The Gandalf's prophecy came true: the winter has come.

144
00:27:54.825 --> 00:28:07.926
The song was merry some time and sad another time.
You know, when you're wet and your baggage weight tripled, and then frost bites, the thoughts aren't so merry.

145
00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:23.590
…and then one day they heard the sound hooves knocking! 
It came from afar, they couldn't see the source, but understood it's a danger.

146
00:28:36.205 --> 00:28:50.440 
- Hey! Someone's riding! Boys!
- Come here, everyone!
- We need to hide behind a hill!
- Why should we hide?

147
00:28:50.440 --> 00:29:08.236
- Quiet! Hide, everyone, quickly!

148
00:29:38.219 --> 00:29:50.785
- We need to be very cautious!
- Oh Frodo, what a horror.
- Poor us! When we have a chance for a breakfast, lunch and a dinner?
- I'm hungry indeed!

149
00:29:50.785 --> 00:30:04.967
- Our road goes to the Buckland, to the old Maggot's tavern. Maggot will help us!
- Let's go, boys!

150
00:30:40.642 --> 00:30:46.590
- Here you are! What do you want?

151
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.565
- We need some warmth and food!

152
00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:58.316
- The tavern is opened to everyone!
Eat and drink, just pay the money!

153
00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:07.070
- Thank you, the beer is delicious! And the pastries are exceptional.

154
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:15.469
- Do you like it? All right, spill it out, who are you?

155
00:31:15.469 --> 00:31:26.233
Actually, I know that myself. Who in the Shire doesn't know Frodo Baggins and his good fellows?

156
00:31:28.663 --> 00:31:36.655
- Mister, I'm not Frodo Baggins. My name is Underhill.

157
00:31:36.655 --> 00:31:42.513
- Why would you change the name? But I've a guess

158
00:31:42.513 --> 00:31:51.680
- What could you guess? Our travel is a secret. We only need to get to the ferry…

159
00:31:51.680 --> 00:32:02.512
- Gotcha! I must warn you! Although maybe you don't need it…
- We need it! Master! Speak!

160
00:32:02.512 --> 00:32:16.899
- Three days ago I heard my dogs barking furiously. There was a scary rider knocking on my gate.
- What a horror!
- All clad in black, on black horse.

161
00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:30.459
- What was next?
- He kept asking if I know where Frodo from the Bag End and the three friends of him had gone. "Tell me where, I'll bring you gold!"

162
00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:40.194
… he was so scary: hissed, growled,  bowed to the ground, as if he wasn't alive…
- And what did you say?

163
00:32:42.453 --> 00:32:54.446
- And I was all like: Get out of here, bring your gold to someone else, I know nothing!

164
00:32:54.446 --> 00:33:01.648
- Quiet, quiet! So, you don't need gold, but keep asking money from us, eh?

0 165
00:33:01.648 --> 00:33:10.868
- Of course, you gotta pay for the drinks, but for betrayal… I don't need money for betrayal, I'm an honest person!
My life isn't easy but I never betrayed anyone!

166
00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:28.441
But about you — I know something. The folks are talking!
- What?
- You're good lads! Never did evil to anyone! Go back home, live quietly!…

167
00:33:28.441 --> 00:33:53.275
- You see, we never did evil. My word! And will never do to anyone.
But I have to ask for a favor: help us to get to the river ferry. Be a lad!

168
00:33:53.275 --> 00:34:10.286
- Do you have coin for that? Ah, just kidding!
I'll ask my brothers to bring you there safely.
Hurry up! The night is coming.

169
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:33.473
- My dear, my good Hobbits! I thought it well, and I decided: our travel is vey dangerous.
It's nothing like a quest for a treasure, not a "trip there and back again".
The death awaits at every corner!

170
00:34:33.473 --> 00:34:44.862
- Ah, Frodo, like we'd never guessed! We only follow this Ring because we know how dangerous the road is.
We go to help you!

171
00:34:44.862 --> 00:34:49.663
- "The Ring"? You said "the Ring", Merry? How do you know?

172
00:34:49.663 --> 00:34:59.641
- Did you think we don't know? I knew about the Ring for like, 100 years. Bilbo himself told me.
You wanted to be secretive, so I didn't chatter…

173
00:34:59.641 --> 00:35:09.788
- I know about the Ring too. By accident…
-… And so when Gandalf asked us to help you, we said nothing against!

174
00:35:09.788 --> 00:35:19.058
- Remember, he told you: "Take those you can trust".
- Who can I trust now? With friends like this…

175
00:35:19.058 --> 00:35:29.692 
- We'll go into fire, and water, and snow for you!
- We won't abandon you, don't even think about it! We're your friends!

176
00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:38.733
- Thanks, friends!
- Frodo, we follow you with full understanding, don't worry!

177
00:36:06.293 --> 00:36:31.664
The road went uphill. Tree branches were getting denser and darker. The silence was eerie.
But Hobbits felt like they were being watched by cold, suspicious, hostile eyes.

178
00:36:40.988 --> 00:36:50.890
- Where's the winter?
- It probably ended… or suspended

179
00:36:50.890 --> 00:37:07.134
- Ouch, friends! Looks like we're in the Old Forest.
- They tell scary stories about unholy things here…

180
00:37:07.134 --> 00:37:32.371
- Enough, Pippin, I don't believe int this fairytales… but they say the trees in this forest don't like strangers… and they watch…watch with all their…
- Leaves? They don't have eyes, don't they?

181
00:37:32.371 --> 00:37:36.541
- Got scared?
- A bit…
- And you, Brandybuck?
- No, and you?
- And Pippin got scared!

182
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:44.429 
- Anyway, we had to go through the Old Forest. There's no other road. No way to avoid the Old Forest.

183
00:37:44.759 --> 00:37:59.247
- Let me throught! Let me through! I plan no malice!
- Quiet, don't cry! It won't help. We're going to die together…

184
00:37:59.247 --> 00:38:02.993 
- We won't die, where did you get that? Neither together nor by ourselves.

185
00:38:02.993 --> 00:38:15.587
- I feel drowsy… I'm falling asleep…
- Frodo, don't sleep!
- Why?
- It's not a mere sleep!
- It's a sleep!

186
00:38:15.587 --> 00:38:23.057
- It's some kind of sorcery!
- No, Brandybuck…
- I'm falling asleep too…

187
00:38:23.057 --> 00:38:28.891
- I'm falling asleep too…I'm falling asleep too…

188
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:57.214
- It's me, eternal Old Man Willow, casting an eternal sleep on you!
Enjoy it! Let all your troubles go.

189
00:38:57.214 --> 00:39:23.382
…Your bodies will weaken, and you'll be a food for the trees of the Old Forest!

190
00:39:23.382 --> 00:39:56.206
Stay here! Eternal sleep! This is what every conscientious person should strive for!

191
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:13.923 
- Whose are these feet? Ah, Brandybuck! Merry! What happened to you?

192
00:40:13.923 --> 00:40:19.281 
Pippin! Sam! Wake up, lads, we're in trouble!

193
00:40:19.281 --> 00:40:27.468
- What happened?
- Brandybuck got caught! The Willow swallowed him! Help me!

194
00:40:27.468 -->00:40:36.0304 
- Ah you, unholy thing! Wait a bit, I'll bring some fire and we'll burn its skin. Maybe then it'll let our Merry go!


195
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:41.551
- Sam, help me! Merry, do you hear us?

196
00:40:41.551 --> 00:40:51.986 
- Here, let me put fire on it. Here, get it! How are you, Merry?

197
00:40:51.986 --> 00:40:59.359
- Stop it! Stop it! Or this thing will cut me in half!

198
00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:07.726
- Remove the fire!… Quiet! I here a song!

199
00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:17.684
A song! The help is near! Boys, follow me!

200
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:56.121
- Whoa! Whoa! steady there! Now, my little fellows,
Where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows?
What's the matter here then?
Do you know who I am?
I'm Tom Bombadil!
Tell me what's your trouble!`

201
00:41:56.121 --> 00:42:02.737
- Sir! My friend is caught in the willow-tree!

202
00:42:02.737 --> 00:42:14.252 
- What? Old Man Willow? Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for him.

203
00:42:14.252 --> 00:42:23.924 
You let him out again, Old Man Willow! What be you a-thinking of? You shouldn't be waking!
Eat earth, Dig deep! Drink water! Bombadil is talking!

204
00:42:23.9248 --> 00:42:29.465 
- One! Two! Three!

205
00:42:29.465 --> 00:42:42.045
- Thank you sir!
- You shall come home with me! The table is laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and butter. Golderry is waiting.

206
00:42:42.045 --> 00:42:57.213
- He speaks in poems!
- Who's this Goldberry?
- Maybe his wife?

207
00:42:57.213 --> 00:43:00.255
- Time enough for questions around the supper table.
You follow after me a quick as you are able!

208
00:43:40.165 --> 00:44:00.618
- Don't worry, dear friends. No danger will find you here. Leave the damp night in the forest!
Maybe you're still afraid of the fogs, dark trees, swamps and sloughs? Forget it! No fears! Now you're safe with Tom Bombadil!

209
00:44:00.618 --> 00:44:18.659
- Here's my pretty lady! Here's my Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle!
Is the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter,
milk, cheese and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for us? Is the supper ready?

210
00:44:18.659 --> 00:44:30.545
- Let's eat, lads!
- Wash yourself first! Warm clean water is the best way to leave the fears behind!

211
00:44:54.102 --> 00:45:05.379
- Now it's time for the supper.
- Eat boys, eat!

212
00:45:05.379 --> 00:45:13.190
- Time to sleep. The night will fly quickly, and you'll be ready to continue your travel.

213
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:27.826
- Sleep… Sleep… Sleep…

214
00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:50.356
- Who are you, the giant? Tell me!
- Don't you know my name, Tom? That's the only answer. 
- And I am Frodo!
- Restore your strength and fear nothing. I know everything about you, no need to tell. I'm glad I can help you on your long path.
- Thank you!

215
00:45:50.356 --> 00:46:04.102
- Show me your magic ring.
- The Ring? Well, I can even give it up to you…

216
00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:11.050
- No, no, just show it to me.
- Here, take it from me, it's scary…

217
00:46:16.282 --> 00:46:28.166
- There're forces stronger than this Ring. The force of fearlessness and love for life will damage it… But only you can destroy it once and for all.

218
00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:45.363 
- We?
- Yes. Take it back. 
Tomorrow, new trials await you. Be prepared for everything. Go the western slope of the Downs, besides the Barrows.

219
00:46:45.363 --> 00:46:48.388
…If you're lucky, you'll strike the Great Road in a day's journey.
- …The Great Road…

220
00:46:48.388 --> 00:46:59.392
- Listen carefully and remember:
Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,
By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!
Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!

221
00:46:59.392 --> 00:47:04.629
- This is in case you're in trouble.
- …in case we're in trouble…

222
00:47:04.629 --> 00:47:13.151
- Now sleep!
- Good night!
- Good night!

223
00:47:18.775 --> 00:47:44.475
- Frodo, my friend! Now you're safe with your friends. But remember, this is just a respite.
New dangers await for you. The winter will return.

224
00:47:45.416 --> 00:48:02.039
- Wake up, friends! Get up!
Speed now! And hold to your purpose!

225
00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:08.001
North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps.

226
00:48:08.001 --> 00:48:18.398 
Farewell! Happy travels!

227
00:49:22.387 --> 00:49:37.089
- Looks like I'm lost.
Merry! Sam! Pippin! Where're you, boys?

228
00:49:37.089 --> 00:49:45.293
- FRODO! FRODO!
- Lord, I'm scared!

229
00:49:45.293 --> 00:50:02
END OF PART 11

Three rings for the Elven-kings under the sky

00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:32.898
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone

3
00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:59.775
Nine for mortal men doomed to die

4
00:01:04.37475 --> 00:01:14.337
KEEPERS (Fellowship)

5
00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:23.016
A fantasy based on the novel by JRR Tolkien

6
00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.315
Part 1

7
00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:41.7293 
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

8
00:01:41.72913 --> 00:01:54.629
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,

9
00:01:54.629 --> 00:02:10.405
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

9
00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:18.780
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.”

10
00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:58.935
Our story is largely concerned with Hobbits

11 
00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:05.468 
We'll get familiar with their lifestyle and customs

12
00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:08.623
Hobbits are not famous, but they're are a very ancient people. 

13 
00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:11.844 
They love quietness and peace,

14 
00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:13.817 
ripe grains and green pastures.

15
00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:18.652
But now the world is too small and busy

16
00:03:18.652 --> 00:03:22.257
So they live in their own world.

17
00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:26.327
The world that is called Shire.

18
00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:32.709
They're small but sturdy

19
00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.024
In the days of peace and prosperity

20
00:03:36.024 --> 00:03:38.480
They live as they like

21
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.600 
- and they surely like fun.

22
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.116
Hobbits aren't warlike and never fought each other

23
00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:49.483
Maybe they love earthly goods so much

24
00:03:49.483 --> 00:03:53.383
because in the times of hardship they used to get without them

25
00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:53.646
(which is hard to believe looking at their funny faces)

26
00:03:53.646 --> 00:04:00.829
Now Hobbits are preparing for a party:

27
00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.714 
Bilbo Baggins is 111 today.

28
00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.432
Yes, yes, you heard it right: 111 years.

29
00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:13.758
Hobbits had long lives

30
00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:19.561
Even in his 111 Bilbo looks like he's 50, no more

31
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:19.561
- when there's no greediness and evil in one's soul
32
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:27.025
the body stays young longer

33
00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:35.349
— My dear friends! I'm so glad to see you here, at my party!

34
00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.987
Here're the Bulgers! here's Peregrine Took!

35
00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:46.590
Merry Brandybuck!

36
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.326
And you, my cousin, my dear Lobelia!

37
00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:56.989 
Glad to see you here!

38
00:05:56.989 -->
- Bilbo! You're too spendthrift! How much did you spend on the food? Bilbo!…

39
00:06:05.326 --> 
- This is Lobelia Sackville-Baggins! She's always the same!

40
00:06:07.418 --> 00:06:12.563
Lobelia, stop caring so much about my money-sack contents!

41
00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:26.364
Just think! 111 years! A magic number! Three "1"-s!

42
00:06:26.364 -->
Today is an important day! But we'll talk about it later…

43
00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:36.787 
- You've wasted your estate! What's left for us, your relatives, after your de…your party.

44
00:06:36.787 -->  00:06:42.327
— Did you mean "after my death"?

45
00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:51.079
- No!
- Lobelia! It's my birthday! You'll die waiting!

46
00:06:51.079 -->
- I meant "your party"! I meant "your party"!
- (laughter) She meant "your party"!
- OK, OK, "my party"!

48
00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:29.409
- Ah, Gandalf! Our great mage and wizard! My dear! I know you for a century!

49
00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:30.830
I'm so glad to see you!

50
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:41.914
Yes, dear friend, long time no see! Here's my gift to you!

51
00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:54.142
- Dear friends! Welcome to the table! Help yourself!

52
00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:26.572
- So, have you decided?

53
00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:30.889
- I need a rest. Long rest. I told you before.

54
00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:45.944
I'll never come back here. And I've no reasons for that. I've done everything.

55
00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:50.556 
I got old, Gandalf, very old.

56
00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:54.322
- I think your decision is right, Bilbo.

57
00:08:54.322 --> 00:09:02.025
- Yes, I've decided. I'll leave everything to my nephew Frodo.

58
00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:08.900
He's 33 now, an adulthood for hobbits…

59
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.566
I hope, you'll keep an eye on him?

60
00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:16.186
- With both my eyes, rest assured!

61
00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:23.081
- Here, please give this envelope to him, it has all the instructions.

62
00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:27.590
I leave him everything.

63
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.404
- Everything? 
- Everything!
- And the Ring too?

64
00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:38.113
- The Ring? Where's…? No, not the Ring.

65
00:09:38.113 --> 00:09:40.218
- So where is it?

66
00:09:40.218 --> 00:09:45.038 
- Here, but I won't leave it… my precious.

67
00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:52.171
- Bilbo! I think you should leave it! Or maybe you don't want?

68
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:56.979
- Why do you care so much for this ring? Do you want it for yourself?

69
00:09:56.979 --> 00:10:03.964
No, Gandalf, I won't give away my precious.

70
00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:16.999
- Yes, Bilbo! "My precious"! Gollum, its previous owner, also called it so!
Come one, bring it here! I'm not going to take it.

71
00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:25.408
- Gandalf! I won't give up the Ring! I won't give up!

72
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:52.659
- Forgive me, Gandalf! Something happened to me… I'm better now.

73
00:10:52.659 --> 00:11:03.086
You know, I feel like someone's eye constantly looks for me…

74
00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:17.172
I got so thin, like butter on a miser's bread!

75
00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:30.771 
I know… it's the Ring… It's draining me and subjugating me!

76
00:11:38.143 --> 00:11:50.461 
- Reject, reject the RIng, Bilbo!
- All right, Gandalf. I'll leave the Ring to Frodo.

77
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:55.649
I need to say good bye to everyone.

78
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:11.948
- Dear friends! My fellow hobbits! I, Bilbo Baggins, address you!

79
00:12:11.948 --> 00:12:22.965
My precious Tooks and Brandybucks! Bolgers and Fatbellies!

80
00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:29.796
I hope you have as much fun as I!
- We do!
- I'm very glad!

81
00:12:29.796 -->
- Bilbo! Live 300 years!
- Fellows, 300 is a bit too much, I won't promise that!

82
00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:52.496
- Are you happy on my birthday?
- Yes!
- I'm very glad!

83
00:12:52.496 --> 00:13:02.240
but today's there's another birthday: the birthday of my nephew Frodo!

84
00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:16.239
He's 33 today! He'd achieved full age and he's now my heir.

85
00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:34.683
With a regret I'd like to say that, while living with you is a pleasure, but I had to say good bye, fellow Hobbits…

86
00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:37.069
- Why are joking like this?
- I depart!

87
00:13:52.156 --> 00:13:59.087
- You forgot to put down something, Bilbo!

88
00:13:59.087 --> 00:14:06.692
- Excuse me, Gandalf

89
00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:53.673
- Why did he leave all his estate to this milksucker, Frodo? We the Sackville-Bagginses are the closest kin!

90
00:14:53.673 --> 00:15:02.489
- This oaf Bilbo ran away again! No rest for the old fool! But that's nothing — the food is still on the table, right?

91
00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:16.750
- Bilbo departed, right?
- Yes, he's gone.

92
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:27.113
- I was hoping it's a joke for whole day. Although, in my soul I knew — he always joked in earnest.

93
00:15:27.113 --> 00:15:32.034
- Don't worry. He'll be all right.

94
00:15:32.995 --> 00:15:43.102
- He left something for you. You're now the master of the whole estate, the whole Bag End

95
00:15:48.164 --> 00:15:55.352
- Lord, will I never see him again?

96
00:15:55.352 --> 00:16:00.068
- This envelope holds a golden ring.

97
00:16:04.322 --> 00:16:15.648
- Why, the Ring too? He even left it to me? I wonder, why? But it may come useful…

98
00:16:15.64803 --> 00:16:25.205
- Yes, it may, or may not. If I was you, I'd not touch it. It's dangerous.

99
00:16:47.794 --> 00:17:04.568
…Its evil power is so great, it will break any mortal. The bearer of the Ring doesn't die but doesn't really live either. He just tugs his life, without joy and with great hardship.

100
00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:10.853
- Horrible! But it looks so beautiful…

101
00:17:10.853 --> 00:17:25.460
- Beware! He who wears the Ring often becomes transparent, only visible to the Dark Lord, becomes a servant to the Dark forces..

102
00:17:28.642 --> 00:17:32.727
- Gandalf! Who is the Lord of the Rings? 

103
00:17:32.727 --> 00:17:47.768
- The Dark Lord reigns over the Dark forces that make all the evil in the world. He lives in the terrible land of Mordor.

104
00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:56.221
The darkness changes it shapes, grows and wants to devour the whole world.

105
00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:06.485
- I hope I'll never see it myself.
- We can't choose our own fate.

106
00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:08.541
We have little time, Frodo.

107
00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:14.532
- Why had this accursed Ring to get into our Bilbo's hands?

108
00:18:14.532 --> 00:18:21.522
- Here's why:

109
00:18:24.955 -->
- On the coasts of the great river Anduin there lived people very similar to Hobbits.
One beautiful morning, two friends, Deagol and Smeagol, went fishing.

110
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:58.144
- A bite! Hey, a bite! Aaah…

111
00:19:33.699 -->  00:19:42.174
- Look what I found!
- A ring!
- Yes, a little ring!

112
00:19:42.174 --> 00:19:52.746
- Give it to me, dear Deagol!
- Why should I?
- It's my birthday! I'd like it as a gift!

113
00:19:52.746 --> 00:20:08.309
- I gave you a gift this morning. This ring I'll leave to myself!…
- But how, my dear, but why? How can you, dear Deagol?

114
00:20:08.309 --> 00:20:29.803
- You were wrong, my dear… You were wrong… You were wrong, my dear…

115
00:20:32.894 -->
- The Ring was so wondrous, so shiny… Smeagol put it on his finger — and disappeared!
He figured that the Ring makes him invisible.

116
00:20:52.835 --> 00:21:10.542
He wore it more and more often, sneaking, eavesdropping and pranking, until his kin banished him.
This made him even more evil and turned him into a real monster.

117
00:21:43.863 --> 00:21:49.214 
…he grumbled like this all the time, so others started to call him "Gollum".

118
00:21:53.253 --> 00:22:03.620
- Tell me, Gandalf, how did you learn about the Ring and Gollum? Maybe you're making it all up?

119
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:11.578
- Some things I knew before, and some I learned. I saw Gollum!

120
00:22:29.354 --> 00:22:39.307 
- Now spit it out: where did you get the Ring?
- This is my ring, my precious! I inherited it from my grandma!

121
00:22:39.307 --> 00:22:59.411
- From grandma? You're lying, lad! Your grandma was practical, sure, but I don't think her household kept the Rings of Power!
And she wouldn't give them to a villain you are.
- She had a lot of trinkets!

122
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:06.494 
Gollum dropped the Ring in a cave; this is where our Bilbo found it. Now it's yours, my boy.

123
00:23:06.494 --> 00:23:08.964
- What else had he told you?

124
00:23:09.573 --> 00:23:36.456
- I'd threatened him with fire, and he told me the real story. I learned how he lost the Ring… 
After that he all petrified and just whined, as if some horror had chained his tongue.
But he also hinted that he found some wonderful friends and they'll teach everyone a lesson in Orcish.

125
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:39.511
- "Orcish"? Horror, what's "Orcs"?

126
00:23:39.511 --> 00:23:54.925
- They are Hobbits' enemies. You'll learn it later.
It looked like he already was brought to the Dark Lord in Mordor, and the Enemy pulled out of him, where the Ring of Power is, and that you hold it.

127
00:23:54.925 --> 00:24:11.105
…Your sweet Shire is in danger.
- No, no!… You know what? Gandalf, I've an idea: let's destroy the Ring now! We'll throw it in the fireplace!

128
00:24:11.105 --> 00:24:26.109
- No. The ring was forged deep in the mount Orodruin and can be destroyed only there - if you really want to make it disappear.

129
00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:37.376
- Gandalf, your story is so long that I got hungry again.
- Yes, you'd better have a meal before a long trip.

130
00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:45.148
- What trip?
- You're not a simple Hobbit, Frodo. You're a chosen one.

131
00:24:45.148 --> 00:24:52.807
- "a chosen one"?
- …and great trials await you.
Look, there's an inscription inside the Ring.

132
00:24:52.807 --> 00:25:18.149
…Nine for mortal men doomed to die

133
00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:31.806
- You'll be hunted by nine Black Riders, servants of the Darkness. They'll put obstacles on your way.

134
00:25:31.806 --> 00:25:37.031
- Nine Black Riders… Obstacles…  But surely you'll help me!

135
00:25:37.031 -->
- No… I'm a Wizard. And only a simple Hobbit can destroy the Ring. You, Frodo.
- I? Alone?

136
00:25:47.011 --> 00:26:05.332
- You won't be alone. Your friends will join you!
- My friends!
- Yes! Jolly Merry Brandybuck, caring Sam Gamgee, strong as a bull Peregrin Took.

137
00:26:05.332 --> 00:26:09.751
- Well, my friends! Let's go!

138
00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:24.428
- But wait… you need to change name. You were Frodo Baggins, now you'll be called Frodo Underhill.
- Underhill…

139
00:26:26.569 --> 00:26:37.985
- And one more thing. Once you leave you'll meet your first trial: the winter will come.

140
00:26:37.985 --> 00:26:43.211
- Gandalf! How come? I'm afraid of cold, it's always summer in Shire… I won't go anywhere!

141
00:26:43.211 --> 00:26:55.135
- Yes it's always summer in Shire, but the road goes through winter. Onwards, Frodo!
- Onwards it is then…

142
00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:40.341
Here's how the long travel from Shire to Mordor started.

143
00:27:41.422 --> 00:27:51.206
The raindrops sang their song, then first snowflake came.
The Gandalf's prophecy came true: the winter has come.

144
00:27:54.825 --> 00:28:07.926
The song was merry some time and sad another time.
You know, when you're wet and your baggage weight tripled, and then frost bites, the thoughts aren't so merry.

145
00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:23.590
…and then one day they heard the sound hooves knocking! 
It came from afar, they couldn't see the source, but understood it's a danger.

146
00:28:36.205 --> 00:28:50.440 
- Hey! Someone's riding! Boys!
- Come here, everyone!
- We need to hide behind a hill!
- Why should we hide?

147
00:28:50.440 --> 00:29:08.236
- Quiet! Hide, everyone, quickly!

148
00:29:38.219 --> 00:29:50.785
- We need to be very cautious!
- Oh Frodo, what a horror.
- Poor us! When we have a chance for a breakfast, lunch and a dinner?
- I'm hungry indeed!

149
00:29:50.785 --> 00:30:04.967
- Our road goes to the Buckland, to the old Maggot's tavern. Maggot will help us!
- Let's go, boys!

150
00:30:40.642 --> 00:30:46.590
- Here you are! What do you want?

151
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.565
- We need some warmth and food!

152
00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:58.316
- The tavern is opened to everyone!
Eat and drink, just pay the money!

153
00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:07.070
- Thank you, the beer is delicious! And the pastries are exceptional.

154
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:15.469
- Do you like it? All right, spill it out, who are you?

155
00:31:15.469 --> 00:31:26.233
Actually, I know that myself. Who in the Shire doesn't know Frodo Baggins and his good fellows?

156
00:31:28.663 -->
- Mister, I'm not Frodo Baggins. My name is Underhill.

157
00:31:36.655 --> 00:31:42.513
- Why would you change the name? But I've a guess

158
00:31:42.513 --> 00:31:51.680
- What could you guess? Our travel is a secret. We only need to get to the ferry…

159
00:31:51.680 --> 00:32:02.512
- Gotcha! I must warn you! Although maybe you don't need it…
- We need it! Master! Speak!

160
00:32:02.512 --> 00:32:16.899
- Three days ago I heard my dogs barking furiously. There was a scary rider knocking on my gate.
- What a horror!
- All clad in black, on black horse.

161
00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:30.459
- What was next?
- He kept asking if I know where Frodo from the Bag End and the three friends of him had gone. "Tell me where, I'll bring you gold!"

162
00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:40.194
… he was so scary: hissed, growled,  bowed to the ground, as if he wasn't alive…
- And what did you say?

163
00:32:42.453 --> 00:32:54.446
- And I was all like: Get out of here, bring your gold to someone else, I know nothing!

164
00:32:54.446 --> 00:33:01.648
- Quiet, quiet! So, you don't need gold, but keep asking money from us, eh?

165
00:33:01.648 --> 00:33:10.868
- Of course, you gotta pay for the drinks, but for betrayal… I don't need money for betrayal, I'm an honest person!
My life isn't easy but I never betrayed anyone!

166
00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:28.441
But about you — I know something. The folks are talking!
- What?
- You're good lads! Never did evil to anyone! Go back home, live quietly!…

167
00:33:28.441 --> 00:33:53.275
- You see, we never did evil. My word! And will never do to anyone.
But I have to ask for a favor: help us to get to the river ferry. Be a lad!

168
00:33:53.275 --> 00:34:10.286
- Do you have coin for that? Ah, just kidding!
I'll ask my brothers to bring you there safely.
Hurry up! The night is coming.

169
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:33.473
- My dear, my good Hobbits! I thought it well, and I decided: our travel is vey dangerous.
It's nothing like a quest for a treasure, not a "trip there and back again".
The death awaits at every corner!

170
00:34:33.473 --> 00:34:44.862
- Ah, Frodo, like we'd never guessed! We only follow this Ring because we know how dangerous the road is.
We go to help you!

171
00:34:44.862 --> 00:34:49.663
- "The Ring"? You said "the Ring", Merry? How do you know?

172
00:34:49.663 --> 00:34:59.641
- Did you think we don't know? I knew about the Ring for like, 100 years. Bilbo himself told me.
You wanted to be secretive, so I didn't chatter…

173
00:34:59.641 --> 00:35:09.788
- I know about the Ring too. By accident…
-… And so when Gandalf asked us to help you, we said nothing against!

174
00:35:09.788 --> 00:35:19.058
- Remember, he told you: "Take those you can trust".
- Who can I trust now? With friends like this…

175
00:35:19.058 --> 00:35:29.692 
- We'll go into fire, and water, and snow for you!
- We won't abandon you, don't even think about it! We're your friends!

176
00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:38.733
- Thanks, friends!
- Frodo, we follow you with full understanding, don't worry!

177
00:36:06.293 --> 00:36:31.664
The road went uphill. Tree branches were getting denser and darker. The silence was eerie.
But Hobbits felt like they were being watched by cold, suspicious, hostile eyes.

178
00:36:40.988 --> 00:36:50.890
- Where's the winter?
- It probably ended… or suspended

179
00:36:50.890 --> 00:37:07.134
- Ouch, friends! Looks like we're in the Old Forest.
- They tell scary stories about unholy things here…

180
00:37:07.134 --> 00:37:32.371
- Enough, Pippin, I don't believe int this fairytales… but they say the trees in this forest don't like strangers… and they watch…watch with all their…
- Leaves? They don't have eyes, don't they?

181
00:37:32.371 --> 00:37:36.541
- Got scared?
- A bit…
- And you, Brandybuck?
- No, and you?
- And Pippin got scared!

182
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:44.429 
- Anyway, we had to go through the Old Forest. There's no other road. No way to avoid the Old Forest.

183
00:37:44.759 --> 00:37:59.247
- Let me throught! Let me through! I plan no malice!
- Quiet, don't cry! It won't help. We're going to die together…

184
00:37:59.247 --> 00:38:02.993 
- We won't die, where did you get that? Neither together nor by ourselves.

185
00:38:02.993 --> 00:38:15.587
- I feel drowsy… I'm falling asleep…
- Frodo, don't sleep!
- Why?
- It's not a mere sleep!
- It's a sleep!

186
00:38:15.587 --> 00:38:23.057
- It's some kind of sorcery!
- No, Brandybuck…
- I'm falling asleep too…

187
00:38:23.057 --> 00:38:28.891
- I'm falling asleep too…I'm falling asleep too…

188
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:57.214
- It's me, eternal Old Man Willow, casting an eternal sleep on you!
Enjoy it! Let all your troubles go.

189
00:38:57.214 --> 00:39:23.382
…Your bodies will weaken, and you'll be a food for the trees of the Old Forest!

190
00:39:23.382 --> 00:39:56.206
Stay here! Eternal sleep! This is what every conscientious person should strive for!

191
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:13.923 
- Whose are these feet? Ah, Brandybuck! Merry! What happened to you?

192
00:40:13.923 --> 00:40:19.281 
Pippin! Sam! Wake up, lads, we're in trouble!

193
00:40:19.281 --> 00:40:27.468
- What happened?
- Brandybuck got caught! The Willow swallowed him! Help me!

194
00:40:27.468 -->00:40:36.0304 
- Ah you, unholy thing! Wait a bit, I'll bring some fire and we'll burn its skin. Maybe then it'll let our Merry go!


195
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:41.551
- Sam, help me! Merry, do you hear us?

196
00:40:41.551 --> 00:40:51.986 
- Here, let me put fire on it. Here, get it! How are you, Merry?

197
00:40:51.986 --> 00:40:59.359
- Stop it! Stop it! Or this thing will cut me in half!

198
00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:07.726
- Remove the fire!… Quiet! I here a song!

199
00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:17.684
A song! The help is near! Boys, follow me!

200
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:56.121
- Whoa! Whoa! steady there! Now, my little fellows,
Where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows?
What's the matter here then?
Do you know who I am?
I'm Tom Bombadil!
Tell me what's your trouble!`

201
00:41:56.121 --> 00:42:02.737
- Sir! My friend is caught in the willow-tree!

202
00:42:02.737 --> 00:42:14.252 
- What? Old Man Willow? Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for him.

203
00:42:14.252 --> 00:42:23.924 
You let him out again, Old Man Willow! What be you a-thinking of? You shouldn't be waking!
Eat earth, Dig deep! Drink water! Bombadil is talking!

204
00:42:23.9248 --> 00:42:29.465 
- One! Two! Three!

205
00:42:29.465 --> 00:42:42.045
- Thank you sir!
- You shall come home with me! The table is laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and butter. Golderry is waiting.

206
00:42:42.045 --> 00:42:57.213
- He speaks in poems!
- Who's this Goldberry?
- Maybe his wife?

207
00:42:57.213 --> 00:43:00.255
- Time enough for questions around the supper table.
You follow after me a quick as you are able!

208
00:43:40.165 --> 00:44:00.618
- Don't worry, dear friends. No danger will find you here. Leave the damp night in the forest!
Maybe you're still afraid of the fogs, dark trees, swamps and sloughs? Forget it! No fears! Now you're safe with Tom Bombadil!

209
00:44:00.618 --> 00:44:18.659
- Here's my pretty lady! Here's my Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle!
Is the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter,
milk, cheese and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for us? Is the supper ready?

210
00:44:18.659 --> 00:44:30.545
- Let's eat, lads!
- Wash yourself first! Warm clean water is the best way to leave the fears behind!

211
00:44:54.102 --> 00:45:05.379
- Now it's time for the supper.
- Eat boys, eat!

212
00:45:05.379 --> 00:45:13.190
- Time to sleep. The night will fly quickly, and you'll be ready to continue your travel.

213
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:27.826
- Sleep… Sleep… Sleep…

214
00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:50.356
- Who are you, the giant? Tell me!
- Don't you know my name, Tom? That's the only answer. 
- And I am Frodo!
- Restore your strength and fear nothing. I know everything about you, no need to tell. I'm glad I can help you on your long path.
- Thank you!

215
00:45:50.356 --> 00:46:04.102
- Show me your magic ring.
- The Ring? Well, I can even give it up to you…

216
00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:11.050
- No, no, just show it to me.
- Here, take it from me, it's scary…

217
00:46:16.282 --> 00:46:28.166
- There're forces stronger than this Ring. The force of fearlessness and love for life will damage it… But only you can destroy it once and for all.

218
00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:45.363 
- We?
- Yes. Take it back. 
Tomorrow, new trials await you. Be prepared for everything. Go the western slope of the Downs, besides the Barrows.

219
00:46:45.363 --> 00:46:48.388
…If you're lucky, you'll strike the Great Road in a day's journey.
- …The Great Road…

220
00:46:48.388 --> 00:46:59.392
- Listen carefully and remember:
Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,
By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!
Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!

221
00:46:59.392 --> 00:47:04.629
- This is in case you're in trouble.
- …in case we're in trouble…

222
00:47:04.629 --> 00:47:13.151
- Now sleep!
- Good night!
- Good night!

223
00:47:18.775 --> 00:47:44.475
- Frodo, my friend! Now you're safe with your friends. But remember, this is just a respite.
New dangers await for you. The winter will return.

224
00:47:45.416 --> 00:48:02.039
- Wake up, friends! Get up!
Speed now! And hold to your purpose!

225
00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:08.001
North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps.

226
00:48:08.001 --> 00:48:18.398 
Farewell! Happy travels!

227
00:49:22.387 --> 00:49:37.089
- Looks like I'm lost.
Merry! Sam! Pippin! Where're you, boys?

228
00:49:37.089 --> 00:49:45.293
- FRODO! FRODO!
- Lord, I'm scared!

229
00:49:45.293 --> 00:50:02

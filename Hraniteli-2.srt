THE KEEPERS (Fellowship)

2
00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:17.278
A fantasy based on the novel by JRR Tolkien

3 
00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:21.302
Part 2

4
00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:14.833 
- Looks like I'm lost.
Merry! Sam! Pippin! Where're you, boys?

5
00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:22.071
- FRODO! FRODO!
- Lord, I'm scared!

6
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:27.735
- We're here! Frodo!

7
00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:31.385
- Boys! Somebody, help!

8
00:01:43.310 --> 00:02:06.069
- I am the Barrow-Wight! Horrible and cold!

9
00:02:06.069 -->
Do you see my eyes? They'll chain your heart with frost!

10
00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:32.528
Why hurry? Soon will come the end to everything, joys and troubles!

11
00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:41.835
You'll stay here, underground. You'll be clad in wonderful clothes!

12 
00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:43.631
The gold will surround you!

13
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:48.928
Look. look how much of it is here under the ground!

14
00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:54.419
Gold, gold, treasures are everywhere!

15
00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:59.223
The are cold! They only glitter under sun

16
00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:11.290 
…but underground they are dead! DEAD!

17
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.749
They are plenty, and they'll be yours!

18
00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:28.998
Stay here! You may be dead, but you are fabulously rich! Rich! RICH!

19
00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:34.476 
- Maybe I should put on the magic Ring?

20
00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:39.920 
Then, invisible, at the dawn I'll be able to run through the grass covered in dew…

21
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:52.876
…alive and safe myself, but lamenting my friends — Sam,  Merry, Pippin?

22
00:03:56.614 --> 00:04:06.501
No! No-no! Hobbits don't abandon friends in trouble! No!

23
00:04:14.057 --> 00:04:21.109
- Merry! Do you hear me, Merry?

24
00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:31.731
- Ouch, how cold is your face!

25
00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:37.303
- Sam…You're so cold too!

26
00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:46.240
- Pippin? You look like dead, all of you!

27
00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:52.207
- Why do you lie here like the dead in the barrow?

28
00:04:52.207 --> 00:04:55.797 
Who threw the jewels on you?

29
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.136
Why are you silent?

30
00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:08.659
- Pippin! Sam! Boys!

31
00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.073 
Boys! We shall never perish!

32
00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:18.291
Remember, Tom told to call him if a trouble happens?

33
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:28.519
Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,
By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!
Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!

34
00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:36.812
- One moment, kids! I'll help you!

35
00:05:55.205 --> 00:06:03.536
- Oh, lads! You got some trouble here! You need to be more careful!
- Yes, sir, thank you…

36
00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:07.494
- Now take your ponies and go away!

37
00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:09.753
- But…treasures… What about treasures?

38
00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:12.177
- Don't touch the treasures, let's leave them here.

39
00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:23.816
- Each of you will get a dagger, long and narrow. That will be your protection from the Dark Lord. Now, back to your travel!

40
00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:27.974
Our heroes grew more fearless every minute.

41
00:07:27.974 --> 00:07:35.403
Valiant Hobbits thought that most of their adventures are over.
But was far from being true

42
00:07:35.403 --> 00:07:46.828
Soon they passed a rarely walked upon crossroads and reached the Barliman Butterbur's tavern.

43
00:07:46.828 --> 00:07:51.8102
In the tavern, a new meeting awaited them.

44
00:07:55.004 --> 00:07:57.625
- Here's it - the "Prancing Pony" tavern.

45
00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:01.659
- …"owned by Barliman…"
- Barliman Butterbur.

46
00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:09.888
- Let's stop here for a rest!
- Let's do it!

47
00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:20.867
- Ah, welcome, welcome, dear guests! Bring the supper!

48
00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:27.865
Take your seats!

49
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:38.879
- Who are you, dear guests?
- We're from Shire!

50
00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:44.463
- Ah, I know your folks! What're your names?

51
00:08:44.463 --> 00:08:57.215
- My? I'm Underhill. And these are my friends: Pippin Took, Merry Brandybuck and Sam Gamgee.

52
00:08:57.215 --> 00:09:06.655
- I now the latter three, but never heard about an Underhill from Shire. Maybe he has another name?

53
00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:15.957
- Dear guests!… why do you bug the travellers? Let them rest!

54
00:09:15.957 --> 00:09:29.819
- Mister! Mister! Here's my advice: better leave. The talk takes dangerous route.

55
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.154
- That's OK. I've nothing to hide!

56
00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:39.341
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely! I want some fun myself! Do you, guys?

57
00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:42.975
- Frodo, Frodo! Do we really need more troubles?

58
00:09:42.975 --> 00:09:47.217
You must be in fever. You're so pale.

59
00:09:47.217 --> 00:09:57.540
- I've no fever! I'm not pale! I've nothing to hide, I didn't stab or kill or rob anybody!

60
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.893
Let's have fun, friends!

61
00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:20.910
…Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;
the dog began to roar,
The cow and the horses stood on their heads;
The guests all bounded from their beds
and danced upon the floor.

62
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:46.432
With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!
the cow jumped over the Moon,
And the little dog laughed to see such fun,
And the Saturday dish went off at a run
with the silver Sunday spoon.

63
00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:12.492 
- Really, something wrong goes on…

64
00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:36.796
- Now, mister, better stop playing with your toy.
You'll call trouble on yourself.

65
00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:39.446
- And where do you know me from?

66
00:11:39.446 --> 00:11:49.911
- I know because I'm waiting here for you. I'm waiting for Frodo Baggins.

67
00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:56.665
- But I am Underhill.

68
00:11:56.665 --> 00:12:00.297
- Well, as you wish.

69
00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:35.524
- Frodo, let's go to sleep. Stop attracting attention to us.
- Let's go.

70
00:12:35.524 --> 00:13:16.669
- Ah, I'm really tired… But I want to mingle so much. I miss parties so much.

71
00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:20.665
- I feel bad for you: you're too tired, lost the rest of your brains…

72
00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:24.408
- How can one lose their brains? If only along with head…

73
00:13:24.408 --> 00:13:31.277
- Oh, it's quite possible!
- OK, OK, we need to lay down, to hide. But you two are like "brains, brains"…

74
00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:36.650
- So, you are in fact mister Frodo Baggins?

75
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.447
- I am Underhill.

76
00:13:39.447 -->
- My friend Gandalf described you to me and told you'll be calling yourself "Underhill".
You're in danger!

77
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:50.867
- See, Frodo, see, we're in danger!

78
00:13:50.867 --> 00:14:03.311 
- Quiet, Sam! So, Gandalf is your friend? I really lost my mind.

79
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:05.800
…But this means nothing.

80
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.277 
- Three days ago, the Black Riders were here.

81
00:14:11.277 --> 00:14:19.504
- They were at my throat: "give me Frodo Baggins!" - but where I could get one?
And now you're here.

82
00:14:19.504 --> 00:14:22.522
- Frodo, you need to be careful.

83
00:14:22.522 --> 00:14:24.925
- What are you trying to say?

84
00:14:24.925 --> 00:14:32.215
-  That you need to save yourself, instead of fooling around! Here's a letter for you from Gandalf.

85
00:14:32.215 --> 00:14:37.601
- Letter from Gandalf!
- Come on, read it and go to sleep. You're so bewildered.

86
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:43.879
- I beg you - save yourselves, and I'll help you in that.

87
00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:49.682
- Who are you? And why would we need your help?

88
00:14:49.682 --> 00:14:56.044
- It's not that common to meet a person who offers a hand on a hard path like yours.

89
00:14:56.044 --> 00:15:00.556
- Will you read that letter already?

90
00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:09.368
- Come on, read it!

91
00:15:09.368 --> 00:15:26.182
- "My friend Frodo, leave the Bag End as soon as possible. Run from Shire. The Black Riders hunt you.…

92
00:15:26.182 --> 00:15:29.830
…You can trust Barliman the tavernkeeper.…

93
00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:42.139
…On your road you'll meet a friend known as the Strider. He knows everything and will help.
Hurry up and forgive me…

94
00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:49.969
…Don't put the Ring on at any cost. Travel by day, hide by night.…

95
00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:55.929
… P.S.: the real name of the Strider is Aragorn…

96
00:15:55.929 --> 00:16:08.616
…All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king."

97
00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:14.003
- "G" for Gandalf!
- Gandalf!

98
00:16:21.602 --> 00:16:46.111
- Dear mister Strider! I'm going to test you.
What's your real name? Come on, spit it out!

99
00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:50.656
- I'm Aragorn!
- Aragorn…

100
00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:56.437
- I'm the real Strider and Gandalf's friend.

101
00:16:56.437 --> 00:16:59.752
- He looks like a good man!

102
00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:09.851
- …And if by life or death I can save you, I will!

103
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:15.213
You are tired. but we got to go.

104
00:17:15.213 --> 00:17:21.405
- Gentlemen! I was just told: they're here!

105
00:17:21.405 --> 00:17:24.265
- Who?
- The Black Riders!

106
00:17:24.265 --> 00:17:33.371
- Save ourselves!
- Don't panic! We'll deceive them for now… and I'm afraid to think, what's next.

107
00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:39.101
- Let's go, guys!
- Afraid to think? But we need to go. Frodo?

108
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:49.455
- A decoy first!
- Let's go!
- Godspeed!

109
00:17:49.455 --> 00:17:57.766
- Thank you, dear mister Butterbur!
- Frodo, hurry up!

110
00:18:12.965 --> 00:18:17.820
The road to Rivendell was long and hard.

111
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:25.567
Many times the travelers met the signs left by Gandalf - so he must have been there before them.

112
00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:36.341
And then it happened, the scariest things: ominous shadows started moving to them from all directions!

113
00:18:36.341 --> 00:18:39.541
…Those were the shadows of the Black Riders!

114
00:18:55.797 --> 00:19:05.467
- I'm so scared… I want to put the ring on and become invisible so badly!

115
00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:21.700
- No, no, Go away! Go back to the Land of Mordor! I won't give up!

116
00:19:21.363 --> 00:19:29.965
- Yes! Come here! You're ours! You belong to Mordor!

117
00:19:29.965 --> 00:19:35.045
- Begone! Begone!

118
00:19:35.045 --> 00:19:40.5973
- The Ring! Give us the Ring!

119 
00:19:40.5973 --> 00:19:49.525
- I swear, you'll never get the Ring! I'm not yours! I won't give up!

120
00:20:56.433 --> 00:21:10.264
- What time is it? What happened to me? Is it summer or winter again?
What's wrong with me?

121
00:21:10.264 --> 00:21:17.172
- You're in the castle of the lord of Rivendell, Elrond.

122
00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:22.005
- Gandalf? Am I dreaming?

123
00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:32.162
- I'm here, dear friend, here. Forgive me for not accompanying you on your path.
You'll learn the reasons later.

124
00:21:32.162 --> 00:21:34.626
Are you in pain?

125
00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:38.687
- No… just my arm…

126
00:21:38.687 --> 00:21:44.856
- You were wounded with a poisoned sword of a Black Rider.

127
00:21:44.856 --> 00:21:52.028
- I'm so happy, Gandalf, because it's all over, and I don't have to go anywhere…

128
00:21:52.028 --> 00:21:59.552
- No, Frodo, it's all ahead of us.
Forgive me, friend, but you passed only a half of the road.

129
00:21:59.552 --> 00:22:05.700
- Mister Frodo!
- Sam! Dear friend! I'm so glad!…

130
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:16.534
- I told you, I told you. Oh, your poor hand, Frodo! It's so cold and almost transparent… Just look at it!

131
00:22:16.534 --> 00:22:30.495
- Come on, it's warm!
- Yes, a warm hand… Get up, I'll help you. Be careful! let's go to the patio! There's a surprise for you there!

132
00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:34.958
- I love surprises! Let's go!

133
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:41.185
- Here's my surprise! Do you see them, Frodo?

134
00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:43.964
- Merry!
- Frodo!

135
00:22:43.964 --> 00:22:47.067
- We're in the Elrond's castle too!

136
00:22:47.067 --> 00:22:52.152
- I'm so happy… *ouch* I'm so glad to see you again my friends!

137
00:22:52.152 --> 00:22:58.748
- Be afraid of nothing, Frodo! Of course, nobody wants new troubles, but there's no progress without them!

138
00:22:58.748 --> 00:23:08.861
- Frodo, we'll take more rations this time, so we'll want nothing!
I'll be turned into a horse by the power of Frodo, the Lord of the Ring!

139
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:18.370
- You're wrong, Pippin! The Lord of the Ring is evil black Sauron, we are just its Keepers.

140
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:23.991
- No, friends, I've made my mind: I'll not go any further; I'll return back to the Bag End.

141
00:23:23.991 --> 00:23:26.956
I'm so afraid, I'm wounded, my arm hurts…

142
00:23:26.956 --> 00:23:34.929
- Frodo! Don't be afraid, we all will go with you!

143
00:23:34.929 --> 00:23:43.307
- No, friends! Why me? Why I had to pass all these ordeals? I won't go anywhere!

144
00:23:43.307 --> 00:23:47.788
- And now they wait for us in the Hall of Fire. We'll make a decision there.

145
00:23:47.788 --> 00:23:54.283
- Hurry up, Frodo.
- No, Gandalf…
- Hurry up! There's a surprise for you!

146
00:23:54.283 --> 00:24:03.382
- A surprise?
- Yes, yet another one.
- All right, we shall see…

147
00:24:03.382 --> 00:24:08.236 
- And you, friends, prepare! Prepare to a long travel!

148
00:24:18.315 --> 00:24:39.566
…I'm not afraid of Gollum…
…He used to be a mortal…
…Now he's a swamp monster…
…Who's ruined by the magic ring…

149
00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:58.472
- Frodo!
- Bilbo!

150
00:24:58.472 --> 00:24:59.178
- What happened to you?

151
00:24:59.178 --> 00:25:02.076
- I was wounded in my shoulder, BIlbo…

152
00:25:02.076 --> 00:25:10.329
- How come?
- You know, 4 Black Riders suddenly surrounded me…

153
00:25:10.329 --> 00:25:17.848
- …one Rider struck me with his sword, and I remember nothing more. I only woke up in this wonderful land.

154
00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:26.792
- What about the Ring, Frodo? You…didin't…
- No, I didn't give them the Ring!

155
00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:34.892
- Good, Frodo! I'm so happy to see you!
- And I'm happy too! I swear, I thought I'll never see you again…

156
00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:41.487
- Frodo… As if Bilbo Baggins could disappear!
- No, you couldn't!

157
00:25:41.487 --> 00:25:46.961
- The duty brought me to meet you, Frodo!

158
00:26:14.602 --> 00:26:24.481
- The Hall of Fire is the best place for our council.
The magic of fire is eternal. It bring us warmth and light.

159
00:26:24.481 --> 00:26:33.272
We all gathered here to avoid a disaster, to prevent the Darkness from engulfing the whole of Middle-Earth:

160
00:26:33.272 --> 00:26:37.983
Gandalf…

161
00:26:37.983 --> 00:26:41.217
Aragorn the Strider…

162
00:26:41.217 --> 00:26:46.777
Knight Boromir, an envoy from the Men of the South…

163
00:26:46.777 --> 00:26:49.035
You, Bilbo Baggins…

164
00:26:49.035 --> 00:26:53.372
You, dear Hobbits…

165
00:26:53.372 --> 00:26:54.231
And Dwarves the laborers…

166
00:26:54.231 --> 00:26:56.041
And Legolas the Elf.

167
00:26:56.041 --> 00:27:09.238
- We must decide, who will continue the path to the Land of the Dark Lord, Mordor, to destroy the Ring of Power.

168
00:27:09.238 --> 00:27:14.162
Show it to us, Frodo!

169
00:27:14.162 --> 00:27:30.379
- Frodo, show it to us!

170
00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:34.107
- I missed it so much, Frodo…

171
00:27:34.107 --> 00:27:40.538
- Beware, Bilbo, the Ring of Power kills the soul.

172
00:27:40.538 --> 00:27:45.384
- But…But it calls for me…

173
00:27:45.384 --> 00:28:04.432
Give it to me! Give it!

174
00:28:04.432 --> 00:28:29.453
- …It's over. The pain goes away. Now you understand why I gave it to Frodo.

175
00:28:29.453 --> 00:28:38.645 
I got to used to it. And it started twisting me.

176
00:28:39.335 --> 00:28:53.066
- I'm am envoy from the Men of the South.
The Ring of Powers, I heard, had vanished without a trace… but it is back on the Earth now!
A shiny little ring…

177
00:28:53.066 --> 00:29:11.282
(…it pulls me… it pulls me…a shiny little ring…it pulls me… IT PULLS ME…)

178
00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:17.820
- You have no other way than fighting the Enemy to death, even without a hope for victory.

179
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:25.229
And the Ring… The very reason we assembled here is deciding what to do with the Ring.

180
00:29:25.229 --> 00:29:32.444 
- If the Ring needs to be destroyed, there's no need for the Keeper to go into Mordor.

181
00:29:32.444 --> 00:29:43.123
…but if we need to destroy the Enemy, it's stupid to reject the…military… help.

182
00:29:46.141 --> 00:29:59.653 
- If it happened so that we hold the Ring now, it must be destroyed in the very place it was forged: in the Mordor, at the Flaming Mountain!

183
00:29:59.653 --> 00:30:08.513
- Friends! We talk a lot!
- We're looking for the truth!
- That can be done much faster!

184
00:30:08.513 --> 00:30:15.392
- Gandalf the Gray! You seem to order us. Are we not smart enough for you?

185
00:30:16.446 --> 00:30:21.813
- While the Ring of Power is here, we'll be fighting each other!

186
00:30:21.813 --> 00:30:32.830
- Gandalf, better tell us, where were you all the time we were going from Shire to this hospitable castle.

187
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:42.665
- I was…in a very hospitable place… almost lost my head there.

188
00:30:42.665 --> 00:30:47.942
- Gandalf, could that be because of the Ring, too?

189
00:30:47.942 --> 00:30:51.321
- Yes, because of it.

190
00:30:51.321 --> 00:30:59.782
- I went to the castle Isengard, to the White wizard Saruman.

191
00:30:59.782 --> 00:31:07.756
- Hail, Saruman, the White wizard!
- Welcome, Gandalf the Gray!

192
00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:17.576
- I came for your help.
- You? You're wizard too. Why do you need my help?

193
00:31:34.132 --> 00:31:44.327
- We need to unite against the Dark Lord Sauron who threatens the peaceful Shire.

194
00:31:44.327 --> 00:31:49.683
- Is it the Ring of Power that you're talking about?

195
00:31:49.683 --> 00:31:56.822
- Yes, yes, that's it. It needs to be destroyed promptly, for it brings evil…

196
00:31:56.822 --> 00:32:03.803
- Don't waste words. We the wizards know the value of empty words.

197
00:32:03.803 --> 00:32:09.686
- Why do you see my words as empty?

198
00:32:09.686 --> 00:32:24.763
- Not all of them. For we indeed should unite. But we need to unite to make the Ring of Power ours!

199
00:32:25.898 --> 00:32:37.435
- A new force emerged on the Earth. The time of Elves is over. 

200
00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:51.632
Ancient alliances are powerless in the face of this force.
We need to support it. Its victory is nigh. And those who support it will be rewarded.

201
00:32:51.632 --> 00:33:05.502 
The Wise ones, like you and me, will learn to control this force.
But at first we'll be denouncing its harsh methods, while, secretly, supporting its goals:

202
00:33:05.502 --> 00:33:08.913
…Wisdom, prosperity, order!

203
00:33:08.913 --> 00:33:12.150
We'll be very wealthy!

204
00:33:18.005 --> 00:33:29.675
- Many times I heard speeches like this - from our enemies, the Dark Lord's followers!
I'm leaving!

205
00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:33.881
- You know where the Ring is. Tell me! Tell!

206
00:33:33.881 --> 00:33:41.993
- No! Now that I know your intents I'll tell nothing.

207
00:33:41.993 --> 00:33:51.871
- Then you'll stay here until you speak!

208
00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.268
- And how did you escape, Gandalf?

209
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:29.685
- The strongest of the mountain eagles, Gwaihir the Windlord, helped me.

210
00:34:31.765 --> 00:34:43.767
…He rescued me. But this is why I was delayed. It's not my fault that I was late with helping you, Frodo.

211
00:34:43.767 --> 00:34:50.097
- Saruman turned out to be a traitor.

212
00:34:50.097 --> 00:35:01.258
- Let's make the Ring of Power our weapon, if it conceals such a tremendous force!

213
00:35:01.258 --> 00:35:08.369
- The forces of Light can't use it. It only serves black deeds. We must destroy it!

214
00:35:08.369 --> 00:35:11.583 
- Only Frodo can do it.

215
00:35:11.583 --> 00:35:29.057
- No! No way! I'm a simple peaceful Hobbit. Meeting the evil only disturb me and make me weak. I'm afraid of pain and betrayal, Gandalf.

216
00:35:29.057 --> 00:35:38.379 
- And still it's you, Frodo, who will do it. Because a weak one can do it better than a strong one.

217
00:35:38.379 --> 00:35:53.013
You see, a strong one isn't used to avoid danger and dies fighting, but it's the weak ones who often transformed the world
when the strong ones were powerless.

218
00:35:53.013 --> 00:36:09.642
- Gentlemen! I'm ready to go! I started the whole story with the accursed Ring, and I'm ready to go.

219
00:36:09.642 --> 00:36:16.347
- Stop it, Bilbo, stop it. You'll meet the braves when they're back.

220
00:36:16.347 --> 00:36:23.356
…And remember: even in the evil Sauron's realm you'll find friends.

221
00:36:23.356 --> 00:36:26.207
Those who join you are myself…

222
00:36:26.207 --> 00:36:28.055 
…Strider, …

223
00:36:28.055 --> 00:36:31.074
… Gimli, son of the Gloin the Dwarf…

224
00:36:31.074 --> 00:36:32.803 
…Legolas the Elf…

225
00:36:32.803 -->
…and Boromir, the envoy of the Men of the South.

226
00:36:35.854 --> 00:36:45.668
Nine in total, like the Black Riders who are nine too

227
00:37:06.338 --> 00:37:10.632
- Friends, any proposals?

228
00:37:10.632 --> 00:37:18.210
- Frodo, I propose going back!

229
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:29.872
- The only ways we can return is with victory or with defeat!

230
00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:34.238
- with shame?
- or with shame!
- No!

231
00:37:34.238 --> 00:37:37.745 
- I propose going forward!

232
00:37:37.745 --> 00:37:47.889
- I support that. If we turn back, the Enemy will attack Rivendell, and the Shadow will enclose the Middle-Earth.

233
00:37:47.889 --> 00:37:55.555
- My friends, Gandalf the Gray is right. We need to go forward. Let's go, guys!

234
00:37:55.555 --> 00:38:07.167
- *sigh* Forward…
- Hey, peckers up, guys!
- How can one drop a pecker? If only lying face down?

235 
00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:12.246 
- Mister Frodo! Do you hear it?

236
00:38:12.246 --> 00:38:15.776
- Danger! We're pursued by Werewolves!

237
00:38:15.776 --> 00:38:20.853
- Friends, the cave Karadhras is ahead. Nobody will find us there!

238
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:26.583
- The cave Karadhras is ahead. Nobody will find us there!

239
00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:31.007
- Forward, Shire!

240
00:39:33.399 --> 00:39:47.674
- Hold on, Frodo! So much hassle with you… You're like a little baby! Could you watch your steps?
Always have your head in clouds… AAAAAH!

241
00:39:47.674 --> 00:39:53.977
- Pippin! Hold on! Take my hand!

242
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:15.454
- Give your hand!

243
00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:28.689
- Go, go, don't fall behind! Here's a shortcut! Don't fall behind!

244
00:40:28.689 --> 00:40:41.016
- Come on, guys!

245
00:40:41.016 --> 00:40:46.880
- Well, friends, we're safe now!

246
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.216
- We're in the land of Moria.

247
00:40:49.216 --> 00:40:53.221
- What kind of land is this Moria?

248
00:40:53.221 --> 00:40:59.116
- Dwarves, the little laborers, used to live here.

249
00:40:59.116 --> 00:41:20.873
- Dear friends, let's eat something. I doubt we'll find chairs in Moria, but we can east seating on these steps.
Pippin, distribute the rations.

250
00:41:20.873 --> 00:41:25.960
- And where had those Dwarves gone, the masters of this land?

251
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:32.593
- Evil Orcs attacked them and sacked their realm.

252
00:41:32.593 --> 00:41:37.467
- Orcs, horror! You hear, Gandalf, Orcs!

253
00:41:37.467 --> 00:41:47.978
- Quieter. Don't scare everyone.

254
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.462
- Orcs! We're trapped!

255
00:42:54.965 --> 00:42:59.977
- Strike, the Shire!
- Retreat! Retreat!

256
00:43:27.745 --> 00:43:30.734
- Merry! Are you alive? Merry?

257
00:43:30.734 --> 00:43:43.116
- As far as I know, the dead don't talk.

258
00:43:43.116 --> 00:44:03.117
- Onwards!
- Careful!
- Quiet!

259
00:44:18.499 --> 00:44:26.826
- Walk the bridge without fear - you can see it's safe. Follow me!

260
00:44:52.754 --> 00:44:58.543
- Go, go!

261
00:45:10.481 --> 00:45:17.212
- Onwards!
- Careful!
- Quiet!

262
00:45:17.212 --> 00:45:20.517 
- We're safe! Let's do a head count!

263
00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:32.165 
…One…two…three…five…But where's Gandalf? Who saw him last? Frodo?

264
00:45:32.165 --> 00:45:50.462
…Could he stay in the cave? I'm afraid he perished defending us. Ah, Gandalf, Gandalf…

265
00:45:50.462 --> 00:46:00.126
- We are orphaned. It's all over.

266
00:46:00.126 --> 00:46:07.729
- Nothing is over. The Golden Forest awaits us.

267
00:46:07.729 --> 00:46:11.935 
- But how shall we tell it's the Golden Forest?

268 
00:46:11.935 --> 00:46:18.028
- The imagination is a great power!

269
00:46:18.028 --> 00:46:25.388
- Especially when you're hungry.

270
00:46:25.388 --> 00:46:38.842
- Look, look! Everything ahead is as if it was covered with mist!
Look, look!

271
00:47:41.324 --> 00:47:50.374
- Welcome to the magic forest of Elves! You're now our guests!

272
00:47:50.374 --> 00:47:55.974
- We're pursued by Orcs! We don't want to bring you problems!

273
00:47:55.974 --> 00:48:11.725
- Don't be afraid. The time has stopped here. You'll restore here. The forest aromas will replenish you. The time has stopped here.

274
00:48:11.725 --> 00:48:20.266
- The unknown troubles on hidden trails might be more dangerous than open enemies on mountain roads!

275
00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:29.122
- We're not enemies and bear no danger to you!

276
00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:13.407 
- They all fell asleep!
- We need to awake them!
- No need. They need rest.

277
00:50:13.407 --> 00:50:13.407
# Nothing here

278
00:50:13.407 --> 00:50:24.839
- Tired Keepers lied on the grass. But stunned Frodo was looking around. 
He saw a long-vanished world, illuminated by the light long-disappeared, 

279
00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:33.150
and that incredibly ancient world was opening to his amazed eyes as if it was just being born.

280
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:46.482
He only saw colors he knew: white, yellow, green, blue
But they were so fresh and bright, as if he saw them for the first time.

281
00:50:46.482 --> 00:50:58.018
While here, one couldn't miss winter in summer, or dream of summer in winter.
In the unchanging realm of Elves the past and future were one.

282
00:50:58.018 --> 00:51:05.761
…But Gandalf wasn't with them.

283
00:51:05.761 --> 00:51:09.636
- No, we need to awake them!

284
00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:22.437
- Awake! Friends, we need to move on!

285
00:51:24.406 --> 00:51:45.450
- How entangled is everything in this world! Winter, spring… You don't know what are you dreaming about…

286
00:51:50.553 --> 00:52:03.222
- But we can't dream for too long. Any dream is only beautiful if it can be fulfilled!
Onward to the Forest Keep!

287
00:52:03.222 --> 00:52:21.572
- Frodo, come here!
- Frodo, it's time! Here's the Forest Keep!

288
00:52:29.649 --> 00:52:36.466
- Where's Legolas? Legolas, don't fall back!

289
00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:54.549
- Noble Keepers! I know you bear the ominous Ring of Power.

290
00:53:54.549 --> 00:54:00.904
- And you're devoted to destroying it.

291
00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:10.568 
You're going the hard path, full of danger and sorrows.
- …and of hunger!

292
00:54:13.898 --> 00:54:20.118
- You want to stop the Evil. But this is impossible!

293
00:54:20.118 --> 00:54:22.963
-Why?

294
00:54:22.963 --> 00:54:39.096
- I am Galadriel the Seeress and I tell you: the Evil always creates Evil.
You want to stop it but it's inevitable.

295
00:54:39.096 --> 00:54:51.320
The Evil is the Black star; the White star shining next to it - that is the Good.

296
00:54:51.320 --> 00:55:05.271
What will you compare the splendor of the White star, if not with the Black star?
The Evil is inevitable!

297
00:55:05.271 --> 00:55:13.933
- I don't think so. I think everyone who can provide a help in a trouble, must do it.

298
00:55:13.933 --> 00:55:19.576 
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

299
00:55:33.935 --> 00:55:46.641
- Galadriel! You're wise, fearless and fair. Do you want me to give the Ring to you?

300
00:55:46.641 --> 00:55:57.374
- To me?
- Yes. It's power is too much for me - and you will help us.

301
00:55:59.049 --> 00:56:13.076
- Keeper, I won't deny that:
I often think, what will I do if the magic Ring of Power falls into my hands.

302
00:56:13.076 --> 00:56:21.355
And now I can get it…
- Yes, certainly.

303
00:56:29.514 --> 00:56:31.943
- You will save us!

304
00:57:14.091 --> 00:57:26.558 
- No, I passed the test. I won't take your Ring. I'll stay myself, as I am know.

305
00:57:26.558 --> 00:57:31.009
But I want to help you and to warn you:

306
00:57:31.009 --> 00:57:37.676
Look into this magic chalice - but don't touch the water!

307
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:51.034
- It's me, Sauron, the Dark Lord! I watch you! Give the Ring to me, Frodo!
Drop it into the chalice! It won't help you anyway!

308
00:57:52.399 --> 00:58:03.288 
- You have two roads: one goes back to the Shire, another one goes to Mordor. What road will you choose?

309
00:58:03.288 --> 00:58:11.608
- We have only one road. Only forward, only to Mordor.

310
00:58:25.062 --> 00:58:34.074
- I worried about you, Frodo. If the Orcs are near, it's too dangerous to wander the garden alone.

311
00:58:34.074 --> 00:58:41.299
…Especially to you - you're the truly precious prize for the enemies now!

312
00:58:41.299 --> 00:58:49.068
- Thank you!
- Please allow me to sit here with you - given I found you.

313
00:58:50.779 --> 00:59:06.498
- The Ring… The Ring… Such a small trinket, a little ring brings so many troubles to us.

314
00:59:06.498 --> 00:59:16.905
Well, show it to me. For I haven't  seen it well enough during the Elrond's council.

0315
00:59:24.484 --> 00:59:28.512
- It's better to keep it concealed.

316
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:38.754
- Don't repeat others' words, Frodo! You said yourself you'd like to get rid of it…
So give it to me!

317
00:59:38.754 --> 00:59:49.394
The Ring will give me great power!
Valiant knights of all the free lands will flock to my banners!

318
00:59:49.394 --> 00:59:56.275
And, with the Ring's help, we'll be able to crush the Enemy's host!

319
00:59:56.854 --> 01:00:10.235
Do I look like a traitor?
Yes, I need your Ring…

320
01:00:10.235 --> 01:00:14.874
But, by my honor, I'll give it back to you

321
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:20.482
…After the victory.

322
01:00:22.457 --> 01:00:38.591
- Fool! Obstinate fool! It is by our own folly you'll perish, and you'll ruin all of us!

323
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:56.530
It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me!

324
01:00:57.286 --> 01:01:13.903
- Boromir! Is it really you?
No. I can't trust the Ring to anyone. Farewell!

325
01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:19.379
- Frodo, come back! Come ba…

326
01:01:19.479 --> 01:01:22.819
- Where're you going, Frodo? What about the others?

327
01:01:22.819 --> 01:01:39.474
- You see, Sam, I must go alone. I feel the dark power of the Ring is acting already in the Fellowship.
Everyone is so tired. I must go alone.

328
01:01:39.474 --> 01:01:48.752 
- How come, Frodo? How come? Without everyone? Without me?
What if anything happens to you? 
Who'll rescue you? Who'll make a fire to warm you? Who'll feed you, Frodo?

329
01:01:48.752 --> 01:01:51.985
No, I can't tolerate that, do you hear me? Frodo?

330
01:01:51.985 --> 01:01:55.181
- Ahh, seems I failed to leave on my own.

331
01:01:55.181 --> 01:02:04.765 
You know, Sam - I'm extremely glad. It is plain that we were meant to go together till the very end.

332
01:02:06.008 -->  01:02:11.331
- Frodo! You know, the winter is back behind the gate. I beg you - put on your warm coat

333
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:20.421
All right! I'll certainly do!
But you  know, Sam, in our travels I got used to the winter road and frost.

334
01:02:20.421 --> 01:02:32.828
And if we're cold - we'll make a fire, really!
- And we'll get warm!
- And we'll get warm, Sam! Onwards, lad!
